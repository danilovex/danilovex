### Hi there 😁

My name is Danilo Ramalho from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as FullStack Developer since 2007 and currently I'm System Analyst at [Imagem](https://www.img.com.br) and Founder of the startup [ProjectCanvas](https://www.projectcanvas.online)  I'm passionate about create software product to users, so I've created my startup and working in system development.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), and I like to barbecue with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
